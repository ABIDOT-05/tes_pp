### Exploratory Data Analysis
  In this aspect, I used the data set to answer some questions about the dataset. such as:

- Which abonnement type is most popular among different age groups?			
- What is the distribution of gym members by gender and age group?			
- What percentage of members utilize personal training, and how does this vary by age and gender?					
- Is there a trend in average time spent in the gym based on visit_per_week?
