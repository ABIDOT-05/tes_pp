#### Project overview
---------------------
This file contains mockup data designed to simulate the typical membership database of a gym. It includes various fields such as 
-Member ID
- Name
- Age
- Gender
-  Membership Type.

  The data is structured to facilitate the discovery of key membership patterns and trends.
  
  ### Data source
  this dataset was gotten from kaggle [download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ka66ledata/gym-membership-dataset)

  ### Tools Used

  -  Microsoft Excel for

- - Data handling and inspection
    
- - Dealing with duplicate values

- - Deleting empty rows and misiing values

- - Data cleaning and formatting

- Github for portfolio

### Exploratory Data Analysis
  In this aspect, I used the data set to answer some questions about the dataset. such as:

- Which abonnement type is most popular among different age groups?			
- What is the distribution of gym members by gender and age group?			
- What percentage of members utilize personal training, and how does this vary by age and gender?					
- Is there a trend in average time spent in the gym based on visit_per_week?				


### Data Analysis
 To analyze this dataset, I gave answers to this question using pivot tables in excel

### Story Telling 
-------------------------------------
The dataset comprises 1,000 gym members, with a gender distribution of 503 females and 497 males, spanning an age range from 12 to 49 years. The largest age group is 36-45 years with 270 members, followed by the 26-35 age group with 268 members; the smallest age group is 45+, consisting of 101 individuals.

A total of 50.3% of members attend group lessons, yet 77.9% of these participants do not have a preferred lesson type. The most popular membership type, “Standard,” demonstrates varying popularity across age groups, as illustrated in the preceding chart.

In terms of personalized services, 50.03% of members work with personal trainers. Members’ gym attendance varies from a minimum of once to a maximum of five visits per week. Those who attend once a week exhibit the lowest average gym time, while members attending four times a week record the highest average time spent in the gym.
