#### Project overview
---------------------
This file contains mockup data designed to simulate the typical membership database of a gym. It includes various fields such as 
-Member ID
- Name

- Gender
-  Membership Type.

  The data is structured to facilitate the discovery of key membership patterns and trends.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
  In this aspect, I used the data set to answer some questions about the dataset. such as:

- Which abonnement type is most popular among different age groups?			
- What is the distribution of gym members by gender and age group?			
- What percentage of members utilize personal training, and how does this vary by age and gender?					
- Is there a trend in average time spent in the gym based on visit_per_week?				


### Data Analysis
 To analyze this dataset, I gave answers to this question using pivot tables in excel

``` Excel pivot table
